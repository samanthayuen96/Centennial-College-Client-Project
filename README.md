# Centennial-College-Client-Project
This final project required our team to create a website with our assigned client, an Ottawa-based makeup artist, Corey J. Stone

All code is done by the Centennial College New Media Studies Project team 

UPDATE: UNABLE TO UPLOAD IMAGES AS THEY ARE COPYRIGHTED AND CLIENT HAS SINCE TAKEN DOWN THE WEBSITE.
